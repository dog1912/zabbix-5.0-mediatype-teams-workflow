<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Download the necessary files or clone this project anywhere</p>

<p>2. Access Teams and in "Add apps" look for "Workflows" and ask to create a "New Flow"</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/dog1912/Spotify-Music-Downloader-Telegram-Bot.git
```

<p>3. Search the templates for "Webhook" and choose the "Post to a channel when a Webhook request is received"</p>

<p>4. Enter a name for the flow ensure you have a Teams application connected (that's why I asked to use Teams and not PowerAutomate to create this part comes already configured this way) and proceed</p>

<p>5. In the Flow configuration choose the Team and Channel that will receive the messages</p>

<p>6. Copy the post URL</p>

<p>7. Set URL to teams_endpoint</p>
